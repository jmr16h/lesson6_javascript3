### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The DOM is the Document Object Model, which deals with the document, the HTML elements themselves, e.g. document and all traversal you would do in it, events, etc.
2. The BOM is the Browser Object Model, which deals with browser components aside from the document, like history, location, navigator and screen.
3. Adding and removing document nodes is common when using Javascript to change content.
